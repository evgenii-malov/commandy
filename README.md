# commandy


Commandy is simple Web framework written in Haskell

-- write your domain commands as types
-- write all your fields with smart constructor validation
-- implicit mapping of json objects to command types (via template haskell mapper)
-- auto generation of all errors or success result
-- easy to change internal transport (websocket used)
-- easy to change command data representation (json, grpc, row text, etc)

This is draft for now!
